# Compose arena services

Creates several containers with ARENA services:

* Web server for ARENA (Nginx)
* Database (MongoDB)
* Pubsub (mosquitto)
* Persistence service
* Auth service
* ARTS
* File Store
* Certbot

Source repositories (such as ARENA-core, ARENA-auth, arena-persist) are submodules of this repo. Containers are created from these files. The nginx container serves ARENA-core.

Nginx and mosquitto are configured with TLS/SSL using certificates created by certbot (running as a service in a container), which will periodically attempt to renew the certificates. On the first execution, the configuration files must be initialized by running **init.sh**.

## Quick Setup

1. We need [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). Our scripts are written for a bash shell. See [Dependencies](#dependenciesassumptions) section for details.

2. Clone this repo (with ```--recurse-submodules``` to make sure you get the contents of the repositories added as submodules):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:conix-center/arena-services-docker.git --recurse-submodules
```

If ```recurse-submodules``` fails, or you forget to add it in the first clone, you can enter the repo folder and:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

3. Modify configuration:

- Edit hostname and email addresses in [.env](.env). This should reflect your setup.

```bash
HOSTNAME=full.domain.name.of.your.host
EMAIL=nouser@nomail.com
BACKUP_USER=1001:1001
GAUTH_CLIENTID=Google_OAuth_Client_ID
ACCOUNT_ADMIN_NAME=admin
ACCOUNT_ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@example.com
```
* ```HOSTNAME``` is the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of your host. If you don't have a FQDN, you can do a localhost setup; see [Init Config](#init-config).
* ```EMAIL``` is the email used to get the certificates with [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).
* ```BACKUP_USER``` is the ```user:group``` of the *host machine user* that needs to access the files backed up.
* ```ACCOUNT_SU_NAME``` and ```ACCOUNT_SU_EMAIL``` are the account admin user and email.

4. Run init script:

```bash
 ./init.sh
```

* On the first execution, answer **Yes** to all questions of the script. The script will attempt to create certificates using [letsencrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/). Self-signed certificates will be created instead if letsencrypt's certbot fails.
* You might need to execute ```sudo ./init.sh``` if [your user does not have permissions to access the docker service](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

5. If you see no errors; you are good to start all services:

```bash
 ./prod.sh up
```

* You might need to execute ```sudo``` (e.g. ```sudo ./prod.sh up```) if your user does not have permission to access the docker service.
* For more details, see [Init Config](#init-config) Section below.
* We also have configurations for development and staging. See the [utility scripts Section](#utility-scripts)

4. Open the file store management interface and change the default admin password (**user**:admin;**pass**:admin). To open the file store, point to ```/storemng``` (e.g. ```https://arena.andrew.cmu.edu/storemng```) in your browser. See details in the [File Store](#file-store) Section below.

## Dependencies/Assumptions

### Install:

* **docker:** https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
* **docker-compose:** https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

### Assumptions:

* **init.sh, prod.sh, dev.sh, staging.sh:** assume a bash shell
* **backup user:**  The ```backup``` service tries to change to the owner of the files backed up to a user indicated in [.env](.env). This is the ```user:group``` of the *host machine user* that you want to have access to the files backed up.
* **OAuth**:** You will need to set up [Google OAuth for your domain](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server).

## Init Config

Before starting services, we need to create the configuration files for the services with the right domains and create certificates (using letsencrypt/openssl).

1. Modify configuration:

- Edit hostname, email address and backup user (```user:group``` of the *host machine user* that needs to access the files backed up by the backup container configured in [docker-compose.prod.yaml](docker-compose.prod.yaml)) in the file [.env](.env). This should reflect your setup.
- Insert the [Google Auth Client ID for your setup](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/web-server).
> ### Localhost setup
>
> If you want a local development setup, you can configure ```HOSTNAME``` in the file ```.env``` to a name that resolves locally on your machine (our script recognizes ```localhost```, or ```*.local``` as a local name):
>
> ```bash
> HOSTNAME=arena.local
> ```
> This will result in creating a self-signed certificate to be used with the services. This is the name you will enter in your browser: [https://arena.local](https:///arena.local)
> * **Make sure the above name resolves in your system (by adding it to [the ```hosts file```](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/))**.

2. Run the init script:

```bash
 ./init.sh
```

The init script will generate configuration files (from the templates in [conf/templates](conf/templates)) for the services using the hostname and email configured in [.env](.env), and attempt to create certificates using letsencrypt. **If letsencrypt fails, it will create a self-signed certificate that can be used for testing purposes**.

* Note: you might need to execute ```sudo  docker-compose up -d``` if [your user does not have permissions to access the docker service](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).

3. Start all services:

- For production:
```bash
  ./prod.sh up -d
```

- For staging (adds a dev folder on thw webserver):
```bash
 ./staging.sh up -d
```

- For development (no monitoring/backups):
```bash
 ./dev.sh up -d
```

* Note: you might need to execute the above commands with ```sudo``` if [your user does not have permissions to access the docker service](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
* See [utility scripts](utility-scripts) for details.

## File Store

The web server files under ```/store``` (e.g. ```https://arena.andrew.cmu.edu/store```) can be uploaded via a web interface available at ```/storemng```  (e.g. ```https://arena.andrew.cmu.edu/storemng```) . The store admin password should be changed on the first execution and other users can then be added.

**Be sure to open the ```/storemng``` URL on your browser and change the *admin* user default password (*admin*).**

## Update Submodules

To update the repositories added as submodules (**ARENA-core** and **arena-persist**), run:

```bash
./update-submodules.sh
```

After updating the submodules, to have the updates of built containers (persist, arts, python-rt) reflected live, you will need to restart the services and rebuild the containers as follows.

- For production:
```bash
[./prod.sh | ./staging.sh | ./dev.sh] up -d --force-recreate --build
```

* Use ```prod.sh```, ```staging.sh``` or ```dev.sh``` depending on which configuration you want to use.
* Note: you might need to execute the above commands with ```sudo``` if [your user does not have permissions to access the docker service](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).
* See [utility scripts](utility-scripts) for the description of these commands.

## Files/Folders Description

* **ARENA-core:** Contents of the ARENA-core repository (submodule).
* **arena-persist:**  Contents of the arena-persist repository (submodule).
* **arena-runtime-simulated:**  Contents of the arena-runtime-simulated repository (submodule).
* **ARENA-auth:** Contents of the ARENA-auth repository (submodule).
* **arts:** Contents of the arts repository (submodule).
* **conf:** Configuration files for the services (e.g. certificates, mosquito, nginx, persistence). These files are generated by ```init.sh```, using the files in the **conf-templates** folder.
* **conf-templates:** Templates of the configuration files for the services.Some important files described below:
  * *conf-templates/mosquitto.conf.tmpl*: used to generate **conf/mosquitto.conf**. Configures listeners on ports 8833 (mqtt), 9001 (mqtt-ws), 8083 (mqtt-wss) and 8883 (mqtt-tls); certificate files under ```/data/certbot/conf``` are mapped to ```/etc/letsencrypt``` in the container.
  * *conf-templates/arena-web.conf.tmpl*: used to generate **conf/arena-web.conf**. Configures the web server to serve a proxy to port 9001 under ```/mqtt/```, forwards requests to```/persist/``` to the **arena-persist** service and requests tp ```/storemng``` to the **store** service;  certificate files under ```/data/certbot/conf``` are mapped to ```/etc/letsencrypt``` in the container.
  * *conf-templates/persist-config.json.tmpl*: used to generate **conf/persist-config.json** and configures the mongodb uri to the container service name.
  * *conf-templates/arts-settings.py.tmpl*: used to generate **conf/arts-settings.py**, the configuration of arts.
  * *conf-templates/auth-config.json.tmpl*: used to generate **conf/auth-config.json**, the configuration of the auth service.
* **data:** Data files (e,g, certificates generated by certbot, mongodb database, ...).
* **init-utils:** Files to create a container with all dependencis of the init scripts.
* **docker-compose.override.yaml:** Compose file that describes services. This is the file used by default by ```docker-compose``` and is intended for development purposes
* **docker-compose.yaml:** Compose file that describes the base services. Use this with the ```docker-compose.prod.yaml``` to create the production config.
* **docker-compose.prod.yaml:** Compose file that describes production services. Relies on the base config in ```docker-compose.yaml``` to create the final production config.
* **docker-compose.staging.yaml:** Compose file that describes adds a dev folder on the web server. Relies on the base config in ```docker-compose.yaml``` and ```docker-compose.prod.yaml``` to create the final staging config.
* **init-letsencrypt.sh:** Initialize certbot. Called by **init.sh**.
* **init.sh:** Initialize config files. See [Init Config](init-config) Section.
* **update-submodules.sh:** Run this to get the latest updates from the repositories added as submodules (**ARENA-core**, **arena-persist**). You will need to restart the services to have the changes live (see [Update Submodules](update-submodules)).

## Utility Scripts

You can use the ```prod.sh```, ```dev.sh``` and  ```staging.sh``` utility scripts (with a bash shell). These scripts call ```docker-compose``` with the right compose config files as follows:
* **prod.sh**: ```docker-compose.yaml``` and ```docker-compose.prod.yaml```
* **staging.sh**: ```docker-compose.yaml```, ```docker-compose.prod.yaml``` and ```docker-compose.staging.yaml```
* **dev.sh**: ```docker-compose.override.yaml```

Call the script by passing any ```docker-compose``` subcommands (such as ```up```, ```down```), e.g.:
* ```./prod.sh up -d```
* ```./prod.sh down```
* ```./dev.sh up```
* ...

**NOTE**: *You might need to execute the scripts with ```sudo``` if [your user does not have permissions to access the docker service](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/)*.

### Script Arguments Quick Reference

The utility scripts pass the arguments to **docker-compose**. You can use them with all [**docker-compose** subcommands](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/). Here is a quick reference/examples of subcommands.
